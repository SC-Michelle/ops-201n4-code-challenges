# ops-201n4-code-challenges


What is this repo all about?
    This repo is about us learning how to code using bash scripting and python.
Why are you learning these skills?
    I am learning these skills because they could be very beneficial in starting my career in the tech world. If I manage to become well versed with this, it could possibly give me a boost in my employability.
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
    We learned about bash scrpiting, system security and virtual maching configurations.
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
    My favorite Ops Challenge assignment was 11 because it gave me a better understanding of data recovery. This is something that I could have used a lot during school.
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
    This is still something I am still trying to understand. Hopefully I won't have to do too much shellscripting until I am mor comfortable with it.
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
    Definitely all of them. I didn't have as much time to fully understand what I was actually doing.
What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
    Everything. I need to take more time to really understand everything.
